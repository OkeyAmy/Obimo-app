This is the list I want to build right now. I have cleaned it up, organized it, and expanded it into a complete plan while keeping the same tone and intent I used. I also added the things that were missing so the entire setup is clear and build ready.

## 1. Overall Goal

I want to build a location based application that uses interactive maps and 3D maps, supports AI powered recommendations, and scales as more users join. The system must be production ready, consistent in design, and built with a clear workflow from database to UI to AI.

The app must always work even if one map provider becomes unavailable or usage limits are reached.

## 2. Core Technology Stack

### Maps and Visualization

We will use two map providers together

Google 3D Map Visualization
Used primarily for 3D map experiences and advanced visualization

Mapbox
Used as a fallback and also for standard map rendering

If Google 3D map quota is exhausted, the system must automatically switch to Mapbox without breaking functionality

Both map providers must support
Map markers
Clustering
3D view where applicable
Smooth zoom and camera movement

### AI

We will use the Gemini 3 model

The API key will be provided later

AI will be used for
User recommendations
Learning from user behavior
Improving recommendations as more users join the app
Context aware suggestions based on location, activity, and interactions

## 3. Database First Architecture

There must be no hardcoded sample data in the application code

All sample data must be stored directly in the database

All tables must be created explicitly
No dynamic table generation from code

The database is the single source of truth

### Core Tables Required

Users table
Stores user profile information, preferences, and metadata

Locations table
Stores physical locations displayed on the map
Includes coordinates, map provider compatibility data, and marker settings

MapMarkers table
Controls marker type, appearance, status, and interaction behavior

UserInteractions table
Tracks clicks, views, likes, shares, visits, and other actions

Recommendations table
Stores recommended user pairs and confidence scores

AITrainingSignals table
Stores anonymized signals used to improve recommendations over time

MapProviderStatus table
Tracks Google and Mapbox usage, availability, and fallback logic

Sessions table
Tracks active user sessions and location context

All relationships between tables must be clearly defined and indexed for performance

## 4. Sample Data Strategy

Instead of adding mock data inside the code

We will
Insert realistic sample users into the Users table
Insert real world like locations into the Locations table
Insert markers linked to locations
Insert interaction history to simulate real usage

This allows
Testing AI learning
Testing recommendation logic
Testing map rendering with real database driven data

## 5. Recommendation System Logic

The recommendation system must not be static

It must
Recommend users to other users
Improve recommendations as more users join
Learn from interactions over time

### Recommendation Inputs

Location proximity
Shared interests
Interaction frequency
Time spent viewing similar markers
User engagement patterns

### Learning Behavior

As more users join
The system continuously updates similarity scores
Older recommendations decay over time
New behavior has higher weight

AI uses stored signals from the database to refine future recommendations

## 6. Map and Marker Behavior

Markers must exist on both standard maps and 3D maps

Marker requirements
Clickable
Dynamic based on zoom level
Cluster when dense
Expandable in 3D view

Marker data must always come from the database

Marker interactions must be tracked and stored

## 7. UI and Interaction Design Flow

The UI is designed around how the user interacts with the map and recommendations

### Entry Flow

User opens the app
Map loads with nearest relevant markers
Provider selection happens silently in the background

### Exploration Flow

User pans or zooms the map
Markers update dynamically
3D view activates where supported

### Interaction Flow

User clicks a marker
Detailed view opens
Related users and locations are suggested

### Recommendation Flow

User sees recommended users
Can connect, follow, or ignore
Actions feed back into the AI learning loop

### Fallback Flow

If Google 3D map is unavailable
System switches to Mapbox
UI remains consistent
No broken experience

## 8. Design Consistency Rules

Consistent spacing, colors, and typography across all screens

Same interaction patterns for markers and cards

Same behavior for recommendations across map and profile views

No visual or behavioral differences when switching map providers

## 9. System Workflow Summary

Database stores everything
Maps read directly from the database
Markers are rendered from stored data
User interactions are logged
AI reads interaction signals
Recommendations improve continuously
UI reflects updated data in real time

This ensures scalability, reliability, and long term learning without rebuilding logic later

## 10. Final Notes

No sample code for data
No hardcoded mock objects
Everything must be database driven

The system must be ready for growth from day one

Maps, AI, database, and UI must work as one connected system
